OpMenu is a python based script for basic system administration.

It follows the Gomenu script guidelines (http://fossies.org/unix/privat/old/gomenu-0.8.1.tar.gz/index_af.html). OpMenu uses .mnu files to build a screen menu that allow to low levels sysadmins and system operators do basic and preconfigured actions (f.e. restart a webserver, check the status of a daemon, etc...)

You can find some basic .mnu examples files in the repository. All menu options have to begin with $MENU key and all the actions have to contain .sh or sudo string. A lot of Gomenu .mnu must be compatibles.

For automatic start of the program you must add the next lines in the .bash_profile of the user:

exec  ./opmenu.py

Requirements:

* Python 2.X
* main.mnu file

TODO

* English translation
* Error control
* Log system
* Improve Look&Feel

Comments and request are welcome.
